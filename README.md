What is this?
------------

[Transcriber](https://llooker.github.io/transcriber/) is a web application that you
can use to:

**1)** Conduct a variety of different types of customer reviews (model,
architecture, etc.)

**2)** Automatically create a Google Doc deliverable with your findings
(like [this
one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZKdM2cGvPHWA0QNIvnZrS4NFVRUqvr0uaGVKHTUXWY/edit))

Transcriber complements the delivery guides specified in the
services offerings for our various review deliverables. The web
application fetches ***verified*** ***knowledge*** related to a
review or audit topic and creates an interactive experience that a consultant can
either work through on their own, or complete with the customer's
participation.

The Guru knowledge management system is used to store the content
presented by Transcriber. The content is saved in verified cards on the
[Transcriber](https://app.getguru.com/boards/yiKXnGpi/Transcriber)
board.

How You Can Help:
-----------------

-   You can contribute to the Guru
    cards on the [Transcriber](https://app.getguru.com/boards/yiKXnGpi/Transcriber)
    board to make them more specific (for instance, we should have
    dialect-specific cards instead of "Database Connections"

-   You can improve the categorization of cards and topics that make up
    the different options in the "Section" dropdown

-   You can make suggestions to improve the
    [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qHC9rC-3GIs6S9j50OQ_Magj03g7KA8xayoWARVHeFg/edit#)
    used to compose the deliverable

Feature Requests
----------------

-   Allow rows to have custom scoring criteria, this could be built by
    adding a 2nd column to the card containing a scoring rubric e.g.
    0-4, 0-9

-   Add a "Prepared by: [Name]" and "Evaluated On: [Date]" to footer automatically

Initial User Stories
------------

-   I can choose templates that correspond to a particular set of
    Guru cards, so that it is easy to load only the relevant cards

-   I can conduct a LookML model review, an on-premise architecture
    review, or any other type of saved review from a template,
    this reminds me to ask the right questions, and makes it easy
    to produce a deliverable for my customer

-   I can mark customer compliance with best practices with a
    numeric score, or not applicable, and leave detailed notes on
    each item

-   I will see a numeric score based on my input, which will make it
    easier to track customer progress over time in a quantitative
    way

-   I can export my findings to a nicely-formatted Google Doc
    deliverable template to share with my customer, this saves
    time, improves the quality of our deliverables, and encourages
    consistency among team members
